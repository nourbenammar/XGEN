Temporal-difference learning is partially rooted in animal learning psychology, specifically the concept of secondary reinforcers (stimuli paired with primary reinforcers that acquire similar reinforcing properties).  It involves learning to predict, corresponding to classical conditioning, and includes the temporal dimension where events within individual trials influence learning.  It's also related to the activity of dopamine neurons in the brain.  Arthur Samuel (1959) first proposed and implemented a learning method incorporating temporal-difference ideas, and its origins also connect to Minsky's (1954, 1961) work and secondary reinforcement theories.  Temporal-difference methods appear unique to reinforcement learning.
