Policy evaluation, in dynamic programming, is one process within generalized policy iteration (GPI).  It drives the value function to accurately predict returns for the current policy; this is the prediction problem.  It's a classical successive approximation algorithm for solving a system of linear equations.  In policy iteration, a complete policy evaluation is performed before policy improvement.  In value iteration, only a single iteration of policy evaluation is done between each policy improvement.  In asynchronous DP methods, evaluation and improvement are interleaved at a finer grain.
