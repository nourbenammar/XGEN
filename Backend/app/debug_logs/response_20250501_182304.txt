Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm focused on a goal-directed agent interacting with an uncertain environment.  It involves a trade-off between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using actions known to be effective) to maximize a reward signal.  This contrasts with supervised and unsupervised learning, which don't inherently face this exploration-exploitation dilemma.  Reinforcement learning's development has roots in animal learning psychology and optimal control theory, combining trial-and-error learning with value functions and dynamic programming.
