Reinforcement learning is a problem, a class of solution methods, and a field of study.  It's characterized by trial-and-error search and delayed reward.  It involves an agent sensing its environment, taking actions affecting that state, and having goals related to the environment's state.  Reinforcement learning methods solve problems involving sensation, action, and goals.  It differs from supervised learning and is broader than stimulus-response (S-R) learning, encompassing value functions, environment models, planning, and cognitive processes.  It's also described as a selectional and associative process, combining search and memory.
