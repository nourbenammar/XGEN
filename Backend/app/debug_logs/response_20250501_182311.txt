Reinforcement learning is a problem, a class of solution methods, and a field of study.  It involves trial-and-error search and delayed reward,  distinguishing it from supervised learning.  It's the optimal control of incompletely-known Markov decision processes, capturing how a learning agent interacts with its environment to achieve a goal through sensation, action, and goal achievement.  Methods well-suited to solving these problems are considered reinforcement learning methods.  It's closely related to human and animal learning and has connections to psychology and neuroscience.  Reinforcement learning ranges from low-level trial-and-error learning to high-level planning.
