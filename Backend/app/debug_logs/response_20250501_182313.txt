The basic idea is to capture the most important aspects of a learning agent interacting with its environment over time to achieve a goal.  This involves sensing the environment's state, taking actions that affect the state, and having a goal related to the environment's state.  Reinforcement learning uses Markov decision processes to model these three aspects (sensation, action, and goal) in their simplest form.
