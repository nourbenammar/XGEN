Temporal-difference learning is partly rooted in animal learning psychology, specifically the concept of secondary reinforcers â€“ stimuli paired with primary reinforcers (like food or pain) that acquire similar reinforcing properties.  It involves learning to predict via a TD algorithm, corresponding to classical conditioning.  A TD model of classical conditioning incorporates the temporal dimension of events within trials, accounting for second-order conditioning (predictors of reinforcing stimuli becoming reinforcing themselves).  It also relates to the activity of dopamine neurons in the brain.  Arthur Samuel (1959) implemented a learning method incorporating temporal-difference ideas in his checkers-playing program.  Minsky (1961) later connected Samuel's work to secondary reinforcement theories.
