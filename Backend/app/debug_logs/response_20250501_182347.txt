The basic idea of reinforcement learning is to capture the most important aspects of a learning agent interacting with its environment over time to achieve a goal.  This involves sensing the environment's state, taking actions that affect the state, and having a goal related to the environment's state.  Reinforcement learning uses trial-and-error search and delayed reward as its distinguishing features.  Markov decision processes are used to formalize the problem.
