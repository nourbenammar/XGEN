Reinforcement learning is a method of learning through interaction with an environment, with a clear goal and planning that accounts for delayed effects of choices.  It emphasizes learning while interacting,  achieving planning effects without explicitly modeling the environment or searching future states and actions.  It applies to various scenarios, including those with no external adversary ("game against nature"), continuous behavior, and varying reward magnitudes at any time, even in continuous time and with large or infinite state sets.  Reinforcement learning algorithms address delayed reinforcement using mechanisms like eligibility traces and value functions learned via TD algorithms.  The distinction between model-free and model-based algorithms mirrors the psychological distinction between habitual and goal-directed behavior.  It's connected to Markov decision processes (MDPs) but adds a focus on approximation and incomplete information for large problems.  Reinforcement learning also connects to aspects of animal behavior studied by ethologists and behavioral ecologists.
